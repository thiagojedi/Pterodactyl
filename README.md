# Pterodactyl

> **Warning:** **THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.** It does not have all the features. Heck, it doesn't have user data security yet. Use it at your own risk.

Pterodactyl is a client app for Mastodon[^mastodonApi] on android. Heavly inspired by [Mastodon-android][masto01], and its forks [Megalodon][megs] and [Moshidon][moshi], the main goal of this project is to have a Material Design 3 (a.k.a. [Material You][md3]).

[^mastodonApi]: And Mastodon API compliant services, like Pleroma.

## Why not a fork? Why not to contribute?

I've contributed to cited projects. And will continue to do so in the future. There are a few reasons I created this project as a separate one:

1. I wanted some features that I could not add to those project because,
1. Those projects are in Java, and
1. I wanted a reason to learn Jetpack Compose, that requires Kotlin.

As the upstream developers were very clear they [do not want Kotlin][masto02] on their codebase, I'm creating my own.

## Will you publish it to the Play Store, F-Droid or other store?

Let's wait until the app is ready, shall we?
